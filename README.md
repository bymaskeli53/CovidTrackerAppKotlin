# CovidTrackerAppKotlin
i made a covid tracker app with kotlin from rahul pandey videos.

And it was so useful for me.I learned some libraries like:
 <br> 
 
 1-Spark for graph  (https://github.com/robinhood/spark) <br>
2-Ticker for animation of numbers (https://github.com/robinhood/ticker) <br>
3-Nice Spinner for a spinner with animation https://github.com/arcadefire/nice-spinner <br>
